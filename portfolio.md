## Autonomous Driving

1. [Lane detection](/portfolio/lane-finding/) using computer vision techniques [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
2. [Traffic sign classification](/portfolio/traffic-signs-classification/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Tensorflow`, `OpenCV`]
3. [Behavioral cloning](/portfolio/behavioral-cloning/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`]
4. [Advanced lane detection](/portfolio/advanced-lane-finding/) with camera calibration. In addition road curvature and vehicle offset relative to the center of line are calculated [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
5. Computer vision-based real-time [vehicle detection system](/portfolio/vehicle-detection-cv/) [`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `OpenCV`]
