### Consulting Projects

- I built an **automated sales pipeline** proof of concept for a client. Performed data cleaning and analysis for auto dealers data all across China, with millions of data points. Estimated customer return dates.
- **Deep learning in industrial defect detection**: Researched, created data collection pipeline (industrial cameras and lighting setup), collected and labeled data, trained and tuned a CNN and delivered a proof of concept to a client. System performance was on par with human quality assurance employees (97% accuracy).
- Performed two AI product feasibility analyses: read and prepared papers summaries, compiled state of the art results on the topics of **3D pose estimation with deep learning** and **emotion recognition in voice data using deep learning**. As a result, one of the clients proceeded to develop a solution for voice emotion recognition.

### Deep Learning

1. **Eye tracking system**. Built a web app for data collection and labeling, collected data, and then trained a deep learning model that predicts which part of laptop screen a user is looking at. My team productized this technology at a [Beijing Startup Weekend](https://www.eventbank.cn/event/startup-weekend-beijing-21527/) in May 2019 and got third place. [`Python`, `fastai`, `Flask`] 
2. **Leafy greens classifier**. I often feel confused when shopping for leafy greens in China. This is why I duilt a classifier to tell them apart. You can try the deployed model [here](https://herbs.onrender.com/). [`Python`, `fastai`, `Docker`]

### Finance

1. **Stock portfolio optimization using SVM**. I developed a novel method for selecting and optimizing low-risk stock portfolios using support vector machines. The model outperformed SP500 benchmark by 15% in terms of return per unit of risk [`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `CVXOPT`]
2. **Sentiment analysis of Twitter feed to predict stock market movements**. I analyzed 200 gigabytes of Twitter feed data to extract sentiments of individual tweets. Then I built a sentiment index that was predictive of stock market movements [`Python`, `R`]

### Autonomous Driving

1. [Lane detection](/portfolio/lane-finding/) using computer vision techniques [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
2. [Traffic sign classification](/portfolio/traffic-signs-classification/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Tensorflow`, `OpenCV`]
3. [Behavioral cloning](/portfolio/behavioral-cloning/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`]
4. [Advanced lane detection](/portfolio/advanced-lane-finding/) with camera calibration. In addition road curvature and vehicle offset relative to the center of line are calculated [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
5. Computer vision-based real-time [vehicle detection system](/portfolio/vehicle-detection-cv/) [`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `OpenCV`]

### Medicine

1. [Predictive modeling in breast cancer diagnostics](/portfolio/breast-cancer-diagnostics/) using supervised machine learning techniques [`Python`, `scikit-learn`]

### Deep Learning: Non-Technical Writing

1. [Why Swift may be the next big thing in deep learning](/portfolio/why-swift-for-tensorflow/) - an overview of advantages of Swift in deep learning applications (also [published](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-swift-may-be-the-next-big-thing-in-deep-learning-f3f6a638ca72) on Medium).
2. CapsNet Series in four parts ([1](/capsules-1/), [2](/capsules-2/), [3](/capsules-3/), [4](/capsules-4/)) — a popular introduction of the novel neural network architecture. This series was originally published on Medium ([1](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-i-intuition-b4b559d1159b), [2](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-ii-how-capsules-work-153b6ade9f66), [3](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-iii-dynamic-routing-between-capsules-349f6d30418), [4](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/part-iv-capsnet-architecture-6a64422f7dce)), where it got a lot of attention.
3. [Stochastic Weight Averaging](/stochastic-weight-averaging/) — a new way to get state of the art results in deep learning.
4. [Deep Learning Vision for Non-Vision Tasks](/deep-learning-vision-non-vision-tasks/) — three case studies about creative application of deep learning vision models to non-vision tasks
5. [Key Deep Learning Architectures for Visual Object Recognition](/architectures/) — a series of posts about the most important CNN architectures.
