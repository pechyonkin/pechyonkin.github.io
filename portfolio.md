## Autonomous Driving

1. [Lane detection](/portfolio/lane-finding/) using computer vision techniques [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
2. [Traffic sign classification](/portfolio/traffic-signs-classification/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Tensorflow`, `OpenCV`]
3. [Behavioral cloning](/portfolio/behavioral-cloning/) using deep learning [`Python`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`]
4. [Advanced lane detection](/portfolio/advanced-lane-finding/) with camera calibration. In addition road curvature and vehicle offset relative to the center of line are calculated [`Python`, `OpenCV`]
5. Computer vision-based real-time [vehicle detection system](/portfolio/vehicle-detection-cv/) [`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `OpenCV`]

## General Data Science

1. [Predictive modeling in breast cancer diagnostics](/portfolio/breast-cancer-diagnostics/) using supervised machine learning techniques [`Python`, `scikit-learn`]

## Deep Learning: Non-Technical Writing

1. CapsNet Series in four parts ([1](https://pechyonkin.me/capsules-1/), [2](https://pechyonkin.me/capsules-2/), [3](https://pechyonkin.me/capsules-3/), [4](https://pechyonkin.me/capsules-4/)) – a popular introduction of the novel neural network architecture
2. [Stochastic Weight Averaging](https://pechyonkin.me/stochastic-weight-averaging/) — a new way to get state of the art results in deep learning
