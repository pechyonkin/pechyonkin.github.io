My name is Max Pechyonkin.

I am a machine learning and deep learning engineer open for high-impact opportunities, with a Ph.D in Finance. Mostly self-educated (Udacity nanodegrees, MOOCs etc.), with multiple projects in my portfolio. I co-founded a company that specializes in machine learning and deep learning education, helped develop curriculums and personally taught various ML and DL related courses.

I believe that deep learning is shaping the world where we will live in the following decades and this area is the one with the highest impact on the world.
